## About The Project

![Highlighting Preview](images/preview.png)

This extension brings syntax highlighting for the META Compiler writing language to vscode. It includes the full textmate grammar needed for syntax highlighting as well as icons to go along with it.

## Installation

The extension is available for free on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Letsmoe.meta-highlight), you can also install it directly in VSCode by pressing `Ctrl + P` and pasting the following:

```bash
ext install Letsmoe.meta-highlight
```

## Roadmap

In the future we would like to support debugging capabilities directly inside vscode as well as other code editors. If you have any suggestions please open a [new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/the-meta-lang/meta-syntax-highlight/issues/new?assignees=Letsmoe&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D).

- [x] Implement the full META grammar and support basic syntax highlighting.
- [ ] Write a fully fledged language server to support linting.
- [ ] Implement code formatting for better readability.
